/**
 * Build the reclaim routine for uploads whose outcome is unknown (timeout,
 * 5xx, network error): the backend may still commit the object after the
 * client gave up, leaving an object no feedback references.
 *
 * `reclaim(key)` removes the key right away and, at the same time, hands it
 * to the host's `onUncertainUpload` hook, which can remove it again later
 * from a durable job — the immediate removal can run before a late commit
 * lands. It waits for both at most {@link UNCERTAIN_UPLOAD_RECLAIM_TIMEOUT_MS}
 * (a stalled backend or queue would otherwise hold the feedback past the
 * widget's request timeout), then leaves what is still running to finish in
 * the background.
 *
 * It never throws: a failed removal (rejected or thrown synchronously by the
 * backend) and a failing hook (sync or async) are each logged whenever they
 * fail, without skipping the other step, and the caller rethrows the
 * original upload error. Logging goes through {@link safeWarn}, so a logger
 * that throws cannot break that contract either.
 *
 * @returns `reclaim(key)`, resolved once the removal and the hook settled, or the deadline passed.
