/**
 * Shared tsup defaults for `@beezping/*` library packages.
 *
 * Every published package builds dual ESM+CJS with bundled `@beezping/core`
 * (core is an Internal Package — raw TS, never published; the regex also
 * catches its `/testing` subpath). Packages override only what genuinely
 * differs: platform, extra entries, externals, minification.
 *
 * NOTE: `fix-dts` intentionally stays in each package.json build script
 * (`tsup && node ../../scripts/fix-dts.mjs dist`) rather than an onSuccess
 * hook — onSuccess does not wait for the async dts build, and fix-dts must
 * run after the declarations exist. `scripts/check-consistency.mjs` asserts
 * no package forgets the chain.
