 * - `authenticate` resolving a falsy value (`null`, `undefined`, `""`, `0`,
 *   or `false` from plain JavaScript) → 401, on every method but `OPTIONS`.
 * - `authorize` resolving `false` → 403. Defaults to allowing every
 *   authenticated principal. When set, the store must implement
 *   `verifyProjectOwnership`: PATCH/DELETE address records by id, and the
 *   check is what binds the authorized `projectName` to the record. It is
 *   also asked, with `dryRun: true`, to fill in the `permissions` of every
 *   feedback a response carries — `update`, `delete`, `createComment` and
 *   `deleteComment` (without a `commentId`) per feedback, plus `deleteAll`
 *   once per list — so clients hide what it would refuse. A dry run that
 *   throws refuses that permission (logged) rather than failing the
 *   response. Keep it fast: a page of 50 feedbacks takes 201 dry runs, 8
 *   at a time, sharing the one `request` — cache lookups per request. That
 *   request is the response's whatever the action, and `authenticate` is
 *   not asked again: a principal it admits on some methods only needs
 *   `authorize` to refuse it the other actions.
 * - `canReadAuthorEmail` decides whether responses include `authorEmail`
 *   (reviewer PII), on feedbacks and their comments — the list, the PATCH
 *   answer and the POST answer alike. Only `true` includes it: without the
 *   callback, every response blanks it. A policy that serves anonymous
 *   visitors resolves a principal for them too, so being authenticated says
 *   nothing about who may read reviewers' emails.
 * - `canCommentAsTeam` decides whether a comment that asks for the `team`
 *   role keeps it; otherwise it is stamped `client`. Defaults to the
 *   principal's `canReadAuthorEmail` answer (whoever may read reviewer
 *   emails is on the project side), so a policy that sets neither never
 *   lets a caller speak as the team. Once set, anything but `true`
 *   (`undefined` from plain JavaScript included) refuses.
 *
