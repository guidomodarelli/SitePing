 * Seeds the demo MemoryStore with a realistic triage backlog so the inbox at
 * /demo/inbox has something to show. The scenario: "Horizon Studio" (the fake
 * agency site at /demo) is a client reviewing their in-progress website; the
 * "landing" project collects dogfood feedback from the Beezping landing page.
 *
 * Records are created oldest-first because MemoryStore lists in insertion
 * order (newest unshifted to the head). Timestamps are back-dated by mutating
 * the returned records — MemoryStore hands back live references, which is
 * exactly what a demo seed wants.
