/**
 * Keeps the widget usable on top of host modals (Radix / shadcn `Dialog`,
 * Headless UI, React Aria, focus-trap…) without depending on any of them.
 *
 * The widget's surfaces (the shadow host, and the overlay, toolbar, popup,
 * markers, tooltip and live region as `<body>` children) sit outside the
 * modal's subtree, so the modal reads every interaction with them as
 * "outside": it closes on pointer, click or focus there, pulls focus back
 * into the dialog, cancels wheel scrolling, closes on Escape, and hides its
 * siblings with `inert` / `aria-hidden`.
 *
 * - {@link isolateFromHost} stops those events as they bubble out of the
 *   surface — document listeners in the bubble phase never see the widget's
 *   own interactions, while the widget's listeners on the surface still run —
 *   and strips a host-set `inert` / `aria-hidden` from it. Keys typed in a
 *   widget field stop there too (Tab and Escape excepted): a host's
 *   single-key shortcuts would otherwise fire, and swallow the character.
 * - {@link installHostIsolationGuard} covers the host listeners that run
 *   before the surface: capture-phase ones on `document`, and the `focusout`
 *   fired on the host element that focus leaves for the widget. It acts only
 *   while a host modal is open, so a page without one keeps every event.
 *
 * Known limits: a native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()` makes the rest
 * of the page inert with no attribute to undo, and capture-phase host
 * listeners for `mousedown`, `touchstart`, `click` or Tab still see the
 * widget's events (its own listeners need them). So do capture-phase key
 * listeners on `window` or `document` for the keys typed in a widget field:
 * the surface stops those keys in the bubble phase only, which covers the
 * usual shortcut handlers.
