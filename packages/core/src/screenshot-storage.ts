/**
 * Pluggable storage for feedback screenshots.
 *
 * `adapter-prisma` and `adapter-drizzle` accept an optional
 * `screenshotStorage` config. When provided, the adapter forwards the
 * widget-supplied data URL to `upload()` and persists the returned URL on
 * `Feedback.screenshotUrl`. When not provided, the adapter falls back to
 * inline base64 (with a one-time warn) — fine for dev and small
 * deployments, a footgun for production Postgres.
 *
 * `@beezping/screenshot-storage` implements it over any S3-compatible
 * bucket (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO…), Cloudflare Images,
 * a database table, the local filesystem or memory. Implement it yourself
 * for anything else.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Minimal S3 implementation
 * import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
 *
 * const s3 = new S3Client({ region: "eu-west-3" });
 * const screenshotStorage: ScreenshotStorage = {
 *   async upload(dataUrl, { mimeType }) {
 *     const body = Buffer.from(dataUrl.slice(dataUrl.indexOf(",") + 1), "base64");
 *     const key = `beezping/${crypto.randomUUID()}`; // fresh per upload, see URL ownership
 *     await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand({
 *       Bucket: "my-bucket", Key: key, Body: body, ContentType: mimeType,
 *     }));
 *     return { url: `https://cdn.example.com/${key}` };
 *   },
 * };
 *
 * createBeezpingHandler({ prisma, screenshotStorage });
 * ```

export interface ScreenshotStorage {
  /**
   * Persist a base64 data URL and return the URL the widget will use as
   * `<img src>`. Implementations decide the underlying storage and any
   * post-processing (resize, virus scan, content-type sniff).
   *
   * Adapters call this synchronously inside `createFeedback` — keep it
   * fast or move to a queue if needed.
   *
   * `ctx.feedbackId` identifies the upload. Adapters that upload before the
   * record exists pass the *client-generated* `clientId` (Prisma); the
   * Drizzle adapter passes the server-generated id the create attempt will
   * insert the record under.
   *
   * **URL ownership:** every call must return a URL no other call returns —
   * key the object by a fresh random value (`crypto.randomUUID()`, as the
   * example does), never by `ctx.feedbackId` alone nor by a content hash.
   * Adapters treat each URL as the property of the one record that stores it
   * and may pass it to `delete` once that record is deleted, or once its
   * create lost a race: two submissions of one `clientId` both upload, and
   * the object of the one that is not stored is deleted. Under Prisma,
   * `ctx.feedbackId` is that client-supplied `clientId`, so an object keyed
   * by it is rewritten by every replay — a retry, or anyone who learns the
   * id — and a URL shared by several records lets deleting one remove the
   * object another still points at.
   *
   * **Security note:** treat `ctx.feedbackId` as attacker-controlled:
   * sanitize before using it in filesystem paths or object keys, even though
   * server adapters validate its shape upstream.
